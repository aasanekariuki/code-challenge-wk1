#### Date Authored : 2024/03/21,

#### Authored by : * Francis Aasane Kariuki*

## Project Description : 

It's a programme that enables one to input student marks. The user inputs the students marks and in turn it prints out the students grade. We declare and assign values to inputs and then they  are printed out.

AN :

A is > 79 , 

B = 60 - 79 ,

C = 49 - 59 ,

E is < 40 ,


# PROJECT 2 : Speed Dector, 

## Project Description : 

In this programme we are calculating the speedLimit of cars. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it 

should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
